Problem Statement:

The problem provides us with a weighted undirected connected graph containing n vertices. The edges are represented by an array edges, where each entry is in the format [ai, bi, weighti], indicating a bidirectional edge between nodes ai and bi with a weight of weighti. Our objective is to identify both the critical and pseudo-critical edges in the minimum spanning tree (MST) of the graph. A critical edge is one whose removal from the MST would increase its total weight, while a pseudo-critical edge may or may not appear in all possible MSTs.
Approach:

To solve this problem, we will utilize Kruskalâ€™s algorithm to find the minimum spanning tree of the given graph. During this process, we will carefully identify critical and pseudo-critical edges based on their impact on the MST. We will implement two functions: one to find the MSTâ€™s weight and another to check if a particular edge is critical. By iterating through all edges, we will classify them as critical or pseudo-critical.
Pseudocode:

class Solution:
    def findCriticalAndPseudoCriticalEdges(self, n: int, edges: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
        def kruskal(edges, ignore_edge=None):
            # Kruskal's algorithm to find MST
            # ...
        
        def is_critical(edge_idx):
            orig_mst = kruskal(edges)
            updated_mst = kruskal(edges, ignore_edge=edge_idx)
            return orig_mst != updated_mst
        
        # Identify critical edges
        critical_edges = []
        for i, edge in enumerate(edges):
            if is_critical(i):
                critical_edges.append(i)
        
        # Identify pseudo-critical edges
        pseudo_critical_edges = []
        for i, edge in enumerate(edges):
            if i not in critical_edges and kruskal(edges, ignore_edge=i) == kruskal(edges):
                pseudo_critical_edges.append(i)
        
        return [critical_edges, pseudo_critical_edges]
